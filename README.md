#Conway's Game of Life

A project to use node.js and React to hack on the game of life problem.

I started with VS2015 Community edition, using an express VS template and jade
to see what the support for node was like.  It was a bit clunky and it crashed
a few times.

Then I moved to using Atom to continue work on it.

It seems to work as is.  Could be polished up a lot, but it was an interesting
exercise.
